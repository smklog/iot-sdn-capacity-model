# IoT & SDN Capacity Model  
**IoT Teletraffic • Erlang-B • Multi-Class Sessions • Retry Traffic • SDN Resource Pool**

This project implements an engineering capacity model for an SDN-controlled
IoT domain with a finite shared resource pool.

The model supports:

- Lightweight IoT telemetry sessions (1 capacity unit each)  
- Control / management sessions (1 unit, with retry behavior)  
- Heavy IoT data flows (e.g., firmware updates, bulk uploads) consuming
  multiple capacity units per session  

The system is modeled as a full-availability loss system (no queue),
which is a natural fit for many admission-control, license-limited, or
capacity-constrained network functions in IoT & SDN environments.

## 🔬 Engineering Approach

The implementation follows classical teletraffic methodology, adapted to
IoT & SDN scenarios:

- Stable recursive **Erlang-B** blocking formula for the resource pool  
- **Equivalent-load** representation for multi-resource heavy flows  
- **Fixed-point iteration** for retry traffic generated by failed control
  sessions  
- Performance metrics aligned with practical capacity engineering
  workflows  

Instead of explicit state-space Markov models, which become intractable
for large systems, this approach provides an **engineering-grade
approximation** suitable for large IoT deployments with hundreds or
thousands of concurrent sessions.

## 📊 Output Metrics

The model computes:

- `A_total` — total offered load (including retries), Erlangs  
- `blocking_prob` — resource pool blocking probability (Erlang-B)  
- `session_loss_prob` — end-to-end loss probability for control sessions  
- `retry_load` — load in Erlangs generated by repeated attempts  
- `carried_traffic` — carried traffic, Erlangs  
- `utilization` — average utilization (mean busy units / capacity_units)  
- `iterations` and `converged` — fixed-point convergence information
